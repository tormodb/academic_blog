  abstract = {All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced. Against this background, the Council on Social Inequalities in Health has taken action to provide specific advice to reduce social health differences.
            Our recommendations focus on the entire social gradient rather than just poverty and the socially disadvantaged. By proposing action on the social determinants of health such as affordable child-care, education, living environments and income structures, we aim to facilitate a possible re-orientation of policy away from redistribution to universalism.
            The striking challenges of the causes of health differences are complex, and the 29 recommendations to combat social inequality of health demand cross sectorial actions. The recommendations are listed thematically and have not been prioritized. Some are fundamental and require pronounced changes across sectors, whereas others are minor and sector-specific.},

  abstract = {Background: school absenteeism is linked to a range of health concerns, health risk behaviors and school dropout. it is therefore important to evaluate the extent to which adolescents with absenteeism are in contact with health care and other services. the aim of the current study was to investigate service use of norwegian adolescents with moderate and high absenteeism in comparison to students with lower rates of absence. methods: the study employs data from a population-based study from 2012 targeting all pupils in upper secondary education in hordaland county, norway (the youth@hordaland-survey). a total of 8988 adolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 were included in the present study. information on service use was based on adolescent self-report data collected in the youth@hordaland-survey. absence data was collected using administrative data provided by the hordaland county council. results: high absence (defined as being absent 15\% or more the past semester) was found among 10.1\% of the adolescents. compared to their peers with low absence (less than 3\% absence the past semester), adolescents with high absence were more likely to be in contact with all the services studied, including mental health services (odds ratio (or) 3.96), adolescent health clinics (or 2.11) and their general practitioner (gp) (or 1.94). frequency of contact was higher among adolescents with moderate and high absence and there seems to be a gradient of service use corresponding to the level of absence. still, 40\% of the adolescents with high absence had not been in contact with any services. conclusions: adolescents with high absence had increased use of services, although a group of youth at risk seems to be without such contact. this finding suggests a potential to address school absenteeism through systematic collaboration between schools and health personnel.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: It is generally accepted that mental health problems are unequally distributed across population strata defined by socioeconomic status (SES), with more problems for those with lower SES. However, studies of this association in children and adolescents are often restricted by the use of global measures of mental health problems and aggregation of SES-indicators. We aim to further elucidate the relationship between childhood mental health problems and SES by including more detailed information about mental health and individual SES-indicators. METHODS: The participants (N = 5,781, age 11-13) were part of the Bergen Child Study (BCS). Mental health was assessed using the teacher, parent and self-report versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), including an impact section, used to measure symptom dimensions and probability of psychiatric disorders. Parent reports of family economy and parental education were used as SES measures. RESULTS: For each SES indicator we confirmed an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Poor family economy consistently predicted mental health problems, while parental education level predicted externalizing disorders stronger than internalizing disorders. CONCLUSION: In this Norwegian sample of children, family economy was a significant predictor of mental health problems as measured across a wide range of symptom dimensions and poor economy predicted a high probability of a psychiatric disorder. Longitudinal studies of the impact of low family income as well as other SES factors on externalizing and internalizing symptom dimensions and disorders are called for.},

In the Norwegian youth@hordaland study, 9166 16–19-year-olds provided information on perceived economic well-being and relevant covariates. Information about families’ income-to-needs was obtained from tax return forms. Adolescents in households with a low income-to-needs ratio, with non-working parents, and in single-parent households were more likely to report poor PEWB. Adolescents with poor PEWB reported more symptoms of depression and ADHD, also after adjusting for covariates, including income-to-needs. There was a significant indirect effect of income-to-needs on mental health problems though PEWB. The current study demonstrates the role of PEWB as a contributor in the pathway from social inequalities to disparities in mental health.},

Socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and age were included as potential confounding variables. We also adjusted for the potential confounding effects from externalising problems on the association between internalising problems and alcohol/drug use, and vice versa.Results:Externalising problems were positively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use and problems (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] ranging from 1.24 to 1.40, all p {$<$} .05), while internalising problems were negatively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use (AORs ranging 0.83 to 0.88, all p {$<$} .05). Full-scale SDQ externalising problems were somewhat stronger and more robust predictors of adolescent alcohol/drug-related problems compared with SDQ externalising subscales, while only full-scale SDQ internalising problems were negatively associated with alcohol/drug-related problems. All estimates were similar across genders.Conclusions:Childhood externalising problems are positively associated while internalising problems are negatively associated with alcohol/drug use and problems in late adolescence.},

  abstract = {Background: the aim of this study was to examine the link between adolescent sleep and non-attendance in school. methods: a large population-based study from norway conducted in 2012, the youth@hordaland study, surveyed 8,347 adolescents aged 16–19 years (54\% girls). self-reported sleep measures included bedtime, rise time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency (sol), wake after sleep onset (waso), insomnia symptoms, tiredness, and sleepiness. school attendance was obtained from national administrative registries. results: most sleep parameters were associated with increased risk of school non-attendance. after adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status, short sleep duration and sleep deficiency were the sleep measures with the highest odds of non-attendance (or=4.61, ci 95\% 3.29–6.46) and (or = 3.26, ci 95\% 2.67–3.99), respectively). also, large bedtime discrepancies in weekend versus weekdays were associated with non-attendance (or = 2.43, ci 95\% 1.93–2.02), as well as insomnia (or = 2.25, ci \% 1.89–2.67) and daytime tiredness (or = 2.09, ci 95\% 1.70–2.57). the associations were somewhat reduced after additional adjustment for depression, but remained significant in the fully adjusted model. conclusion: the demonstrated relationship between sleep problems and school absence suggests that careful assessment of sleep is warranted when adolescents present with extensive school absence. future studies on how the sleep–school absence relationship in adolescence may impact later work affiliation in adulthood are needed.

Data stem from the youth@hordaland study, a population-based survey conducted in Norway in 2012. A total of 7,707 adolescents (47\% male) 16 to 19 years old were included in this study. The adolescents were classified into 6 family structures. Mental health was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). No significant differences between nondivorced families (reference) and JPC were observed. Adolescents from single-parent and stepfather families scored significantly higher on all 3 SDQ scales, and adolescents from stepmother families scored significantly higher on the SDQ total and SDQ externalizing scales. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that adolescents living in JPC did not have more adjustment problems compared to their peers living in nondivorced families.},

In a hospital-based population of school-aged children prenatally exposed to opiates and a number of illicit substances (n = 57), we evaluated mental health symptoms associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire, revision IV (SNAP-IV) and the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) and compared the scores to a reference group which comprised children from the population-based Bergen Child Study (n = 171). Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention. In conclusion, prenatally exposed children had more mental health symptoms associated with ADHD and ASD, compared with the reference group.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between longitudinal registry-based data on family income during childhood and self-reported substance use in adolescence, including potential alcohol- or drug problems. Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents’ participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A ‘never poor’ (89.3\%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0\%) or out (4.6\%) of poverty, and a final ‘chronically poor’ (3.1\%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.},

  abstract = {BackgroundFor alcohol, the association with socioeconomic status (SES) is different than for other public health challenges – the associations are complex, and heterogeneous between socioeconomic groups. Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the ‘alcohol harm paradox’. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed.MethodsEmploying data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.},
