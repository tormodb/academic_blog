  abstract = {All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced. Against this background, the Council on Social Inequalities in Health has taken action to provide specific advice to reduce social health differences.             Our recommendations focus on the entire social gradient rather than just poverty and the socially disadvantaged. By proposing action on the social determinants of health such as affordable child-care, education, living environments and income structures, we aim to facilitate a possible re-orientation of policy away from redistribution to universalism.             The striking challenges of the causes of health differences are complex, and the 29 recommendations to combat social inequality of health demand cross sectorial actions. The recommendations are listed thematically and have not been prioritized. Some are fundamental and require pronounced changes across sectors, whereas others are minor and sector-specific.},

  abstract = {Background: school absenteeism is linked to a range of health concerns, health risk behaviors and school dropout. it is therefore important to evaluate the extent to which adolescents with absenteeism are in contact with health care and other services. the aim of the current study was to investigate service use of norwegian adolescents with moderate and high absenteeism in comparison to students with lower rates of absence. methods: the study employs data from a population-based study from 2012 targeting all pupils in upper secondary education in hordaland county, norway (the youth@hordaland-survey). a total of 8988 adolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 were included in the present study. information on service use was based on adolescent self-report data collected in the youth@hordaland-survey. absence data was collected using administrative data provided by the hordaland county council. results: high absence (defined as being absent 15\% or more the past semester) was found among 10.1\% of the adolescents. compared to their peers with low absence (less than 3\% absence the past semester), adolescents with high absence were more likely to be in contact with all the services studied, including mental health services (odds ratio (or) 3.96), adolescent health clinics (or 2.11) and their general practitioner (gp) (or 1.94). frequency of contact was higher among adolescents with moderate and high absence and there seems to be a gradient of service use corresponding to the level of absence. still, 40\% of the adolescents with high absence had not been in contact with any services. conclusions: adolescents with high absence had increased use of services, although a group of youth at risk seems to be without such contact. this finding suggests a potential to address school absenteeism through systematic collaboration between schools and health personnel.},

The main aim of the present study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and school absence in late adolescence, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and externalizing problems. Methods Data stem from the youth@hordaland-survey, a population-based survey of adolescents between 16 and 19 years old attending upper secondary education in Hordaland County, Norway, in spring 2012. Administrative data on school absence was provided for 8222 adolescents. In additions to days and hours absent the past semester, a variable of total absence was calculated and divided into quartiles of absence. Symptoms of mental health problems and sleep duration was based on adolescent self-reports. Results Reports of depressive symptoms was significantly associated with school absence when investigated as continuous variables. The strength of the association attenuated but remained statistically significant when controlling for sociodemographic factors and externalizing problems. When investigating the association at different levels of school absence, adolescents in the second, third and fourth quartile of school absence reported significantly higher depression scores compared to adolescents in the first quartile. The association between reports of symptoms of depression and school absence was partially mediated by sleep duration. Conclusion The association between reported symptoms of depression and school absence was evident even at low levels of school absence, indicating a role for universal prevention strategies. The findings suggest both depression and sleep problems as possible targets for intervention in late adolescence.},

  abstract = {Introduction Depression is a public health concern among youth, and it is pertinent to identify factors that can help prevent development of depressive symptoms in adolescence. This study aimed to investigate the association between negative life events and depressive symptoms among adolescents, and to examine the influence and relative contributions of personal, social and family protective factors related to resilience. Methods Data stem from the cross-sectional youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Hordaland, Norway. In all, 9,546 adolescents, aged 16\textendash 19 years old (52.8\% girls) provided self-report information on depressive symptoms, negative life events and protective factors related to resilience. Results Experiencing a higher number of negative life events was related to increases in depressive symptoms, while the potential protective factors goal orientation, self-confidence, social competence, social support, and family cohesion individually were associated with fewer symptoms. Although there were small moderating effects of goal orientation and self-confidence, the results mainly supported a compensatory resilience model. When considering the potential protective factors jointly, only self-confidence and family cohesion were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms for both genders, with the addition of social support for girls. There were significant interactions between all the potential protective factors and gender, indicating a greater reduction of depressive symptoms with higher levels of protective factors among girls. Conclusions Interventions aimed at fostering self-confidence and family cohesion could be effective in preventing depressive symptoms for adolescent boys and girls, regardless of their exposure to negative events. Results further indicate that preventive interventions targeting these potential protective factors could be especially beneficial for adolescent girls.},

  abstract = {Introduction               . Children with cerebral palsy (CP), one of the most common childhood neurological disorders, often have associated medical and psychological symptoms. This study assesses mental health problems compared to population controls and the ability of a mental health screening tool to predict psychiatric disorders and to capture the complexity of coexisting symptoms.               Methods               . Children with CP (                                N                 =                 47                              ) were assessed according to DSM-IV criteria using a psychiatric diagnostic instrument (Kiddie-SADS) and a mental health screening questionnaire (SDQ). Participants from the Bergen Child Study, a large epidemiological study, served as controls.               Results               . Children with CP had significantly higher means on all problem scores including impact scores. Two in three children scored above 90th percentile cutoff on Total Difficulties Score (TDS), and 57\% met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, yielding a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.55. Mental health problems coexisted across symptom scales, and peer problems were highly prevalent in all groups of psychiatric disorders.               Conclusion               . A high prevalence of mental health problems and cooccurrence of symptoms were found in children with CP compared to controls. Screening with SDQ detects mental health problems, but does not predict specific disorders in children with CP. ADHD is common, but difficult to diagnose due to complexity of symptoms. Mental health services integrated in regular followup of children with CP are recommended due to high prevalence and considerable overlap of mental health symptoms.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: It is generally accepted that mental health problems are unequally distributed across population strata defined by socioeconomic status (SES), with more problems for those with lower SES. However, studies of this association in children and adolescents are often restricted by the use of global measures of mental health problems and aggregation of SES-indicators. We aim to further elucidate the relationship between childhood mental health problems and SES by including more detailed information about mental health and individual SES-indicators. METHODS: The participants (N = 5,781, age 11-13) were part of the Bergen Child Study (BCS). Mental health was assessed using the teacher, parent and self-report versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), including an impact section, used to measure symptom dimensions and probability of psychiatric disorders. Parent reports of family economy and parental education were used as SES measures. RESULTS: For each SES indicator we confirmed an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Poor family economy consistently predicted mental health problems, while parental education level predicted externalizing disorders stronger than internalizing disorders. CONCLUSION: In this Norwegian sample of children, family economy was a significant predictor of mental health problems as measured across a wide range of symptom dimensions and poor economy predicted a high probability of a psychiatric disorder. Longitudinal studies of the impact of low family income as well as other SES factors on externalizing and internalizing symptom dimensions and disorders are called for.},

  abstract = {Aims:The literature on associations between internalising problems and subsequent alcohol/drug use and problems shows mixed results, and it is important to consider different aspects of internalising problems along with co-occurring externalising problems.Methods:In a longitudinal study (n = 2438) followed up when the subjects were 7?9, 11?13, and 16?19 years of age, we investigated associations between parent/teacher-reported externalising and internalising problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) and adolescent self-reported alcohol and illicit drug use and problems. Socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and age were included as potential confounding variables. We also adjusted for the potential confounding effects from externalising problems on the association between internalising problems and alcohol/drug use, and vice versa.Results:Externalising problems were positively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use and problems (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] ranging from 1.24 to 1.40, all p {$<$} .05), while internalising problems were negatively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use (AORs ranging 0.83 to 0.88, all p {$<$} .05). Full-scale SDQ externalising problems were somewhat stronger and more robust predictors of adolescent alcohol/drug-related problems compared with SDQ externalising subscales, while only full-scale SDQ internalising problems were negatively associated with alcohol/drug-related problems. All estimates were similar across genders.Conclusions:Childhood externalising problems are positively associated while internalising problems are negatively associated with alcohol/drug use and problems in late adolescence.},

Furthermore, knowledge of the demographic determinants for loneliness are limited. The present study assesses recent trends of loneliness from 2014 to 2018, and explores demographic risk indicators of loneliness among students. Method: Data was drawn from two waves of a national student health survey from 2014 and 2018 for higher education in Norway (the SHoT-study). In 2018, all 162,512 fulltime students in Norway were invited to participate and 50,054 students (69.1\% women) aged 18-35 years were included (response rate = 30.8\%). Loneliness was measured by ``The Three-Item Loneliness Scale'' (T-ILS) and one item from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25). Results: Age showed a curvilinear association with loneliness, with the youngest and oldest students reporting the highest level of loneliness across all measures. Other significant demographic determinants of loneliness were being female, single and living alone. There was a considerable increase in loneliness from 2014 (16.5\%) to 2018 (23.6\%, p \&amp;lt; .001), and the increase was particularly strong for males, for whom the proportion of feeling ``extremely'' lonely had more than doubled. Conclusion: The high rate of loneliness and the increasing trends indicate the need for preventive interventions in the student population.},

  abstract = {Background: the aim of this study was to examine the link between adolescent sleep and non-attendance in school. methods: a large population-based study from norway conducted in 2012, the youth@hordaland study, surveyed 8,347 adolescents aged 16\textendash 19 years (54\% girls). self-reported sleep measures included bedtime, rise time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency (sol), wake after sleep onset (waso), insomnia symptoms, tiredness, and sleepiness. school attendance was obtained from national administrative registries. results: most sleep parameters were associated with increased risk of school non-attendance. after adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status, short sleep duration and sleep deficiency were the sleep measures with the highest odds of non-attendance (or=4.61, ci 95\% 3.29\textendash 6.46) and (or = 3.26, ci 95\% 2.67\textendash 3.99), respectively). also, large bedtime discrepancies in weekend versus weekdays were associated with non-attendance (or = 2.43, ci 95\% 1.93\textendash 2.02), as well as insomnia (or = 2.25, ci \% 1.89\textendash 2.67) and daytime tiredness (or = 2.09, ci 95\% 1.70\textendash 2.57). the associations were somewhat reduced after additional adjustment for depression, but remained significant in the fully adjusted model. conclusion: the demonstrated relationship between sleep problems and school absence suggests that careful assessment of sleep is warranted when adolescents present with extensive school absence. future studies on how the sleep\textendash school absence relationship in adolescence may impact later work affiliation in adulthood are needed.

  abstract = {Background The link between parental divorce and adolescents' academic achievement may depend on parental educational levels. However, findings have been inconsistent regarding whether the negative associations between parental divorce and adolescents' academic outcomes are greater or smaller in highly educated families. The present study aimed to investigate the possible heterogeneity in the associations between divorce and adolescents' academic achievement by parental educational levels, within the context of the elaborate Norwegian welfare state. Methods The population-based cross-sectional youth@hordaland study of adolescents aged 16\textendash 19 years conducted in Norway in 2012, provided information about parental divorce and was linked to national administrative registries (N = 9,166) to obtain high-quality, objective data on the adolescents' grade point average (GPA), and their parents' educational qualifications and income. Results The negative association between parental divorce and GPA was stronger among adolescents with educated or highly educated parents compared to adolescents with less educated parents. This heterogeneity was driven by maternal educational qualifications, whereby divorce was more strongly and negatively associated with GPA among adolescents with educated mothers compared to those with less educated mothers, independent of paternal educational levels and income measures. Conclusions Among adolescents whose parents have low educational qualifications, parental divorce is not associated with their academic achievement. Educated divorced mothers appear less likely to transfer their educational advantages onto their children than nondivorced equally educated mothers, perhaps due to a ``double-burden'' regarding work pressure and child-rearing responsibilities. There is a need for future studies to detail the mechanisms underlying this finding.},

  abstract = {The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of delayed sleep phase syndrome (dsps) in adolescence, and to examine the association to insomnia and school non-attendance. data stem from a large population based study in hordaland county in norway conducted in 2012, the ung@hordaland study. in all, 10,220 adolescents aged 16\textendash 18 years (54\% girls) provided self-reported data on a range of sleep parameters: dsps was defined according to the international classification of sleep disorders, revised (icsd-r) criteria, while insomnia was defined according to the quantitative criteria for insomnia. other sleep parameters included time in bed, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, oversleeping, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, subjective sleep need, sleep deficiency, sleepiness and tiredness. sleep data were calculated separately for weekdays and weekends. data on school non-attendance were provided by official registers. the prevalence of dsps was 3.3\%, and significantly higher among girls (3.7\%) than boys (2.7\%). there was a strong overlap between dsps and insomnia, with more than half of the adolescents with dsps also meeting the criteria for insomnia (53.8\% for boys and 57.1\% for girls). adolescents with dsps had significantly higher odds ratios (or) of non-attendance at school. after adjusting for sociodeographical factors, insomnia and depression, the adjusted ors for days of non-attendance were or\textbackslash hspace0.167em=\textbackslash hspace0.167em3.22 (95\% ci: 1.94-5.34) for boys and or\textbackslash hspace0.167em=\textbackslash hspace0.167em1.87 (95\% ci: 1.25-2.80) for girls. a similar effect was found for hours of non-attendance for boys, with an adjusted or\textbackslash hspace0.167em=\textbackslash hspace0.167em3.05 (95\% ci: 1.89-4.92). the effect for girls was no longer significant after full adjustment (or =1.48 [95\% ci: 0.94-2.32]). this is one of the first studies to estimate the prevalence of dsps in adolescents. the high prevalence of dsps, and overlap with insomnia, in combination with the odds of school non-attendance, suggest that a broad and thorough clinical approach is warranted when adolescents present with symptoms of dsps.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between longitudinal registry-based data on family income during childhood and self-reported substance use in adolescence, including potential alcohol- or drug problems. Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents' participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A `never poor' (89.3\%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0\%) or out (4.6\%) of poverty, and a final `chronically poor' (3.1\%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.},

  abstract = {BackgroundFor alcohol, the association with socioeconomic status (SES) is different than for other public health challenges \textendash{} the associations are complex, and heterogeneous between socioeconomic groups. Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the `alcohol harm paradox'. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed.MethodsEmploying data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.},
