  abstract = {Although frequently used with older adolescents, few studies of the factor structure, internal consistency and gender equivalence of the sdq exists for this age group, with inconsistent findings. in the present study, confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to evaluate the five-factor structure of the sdq in a population sample of 10,254 16-18 year-olds from the youth@hordaland study. measurement invariance across gender was assessed using multigroup cfa. a modestly modified five-factor solution fitted the data acceptably, accounting for one cross loading and some local dependencies. importantly, partial measurement non-invariance was identified, with differential item functioning in eight items, and higher correlations between emotional and conduct problems for boys compared to girls. implications for use clinically and in research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the psychometric properties of the crafft-questionnaire, and its concurrent validity with self-reported measures of alcohol consumption and illicit drug use ever among norwegian adolescents. this study employs data from the ung@hordaland survey (n=9680). the concurrent validity of the crafft-questionnaire was examined both as a case-finder with different cut-offs, but also as an ordinal scale. the ordinal scale was constructed by counting the number of affirmative responses from 0 to 6. current self-reported excessive alcohol consumption, frequent binge drinking and any illicit drug use ever were employed as concurrent validity measures. the internal reliability of crafft was adequate, and there was a linear relationship between crafft-score and excessive alcohol consumption, frequent binge drinking and illicit drug use ever for both genders. overall, this study shows a good concurrent validity and adequate psychometric properties of the crafft-questionnaire. there results indicate, however, that the use of crafft as a case-finder needs further research, as a suitable cut-point was difficult to determine. the authors conclude that in a clinical setting one positive answer is enough to warrant further investigation, and for research purposes the use of the questionnaire as an ordinal scale or using a cut-point of 2 might be preferable. \textcopyright{} 2013 elsevier ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: school absenteeism is linked to a range of health concerns, health risk behaviors and school dropout. it is therefore important to evaluate the extent to which adolescents with absenteeism are in contact with health care and other services. the aim of the current study was to investigate service use of norwegian adolescents with moderate and high absenteeism in comparison to students with lower rates of absence. methods: the study employs data from a population-based study from 2012 targeting all pupils in upper secondary education in hordaland county, norway (the youth@hordaland-survey). a total of 8988 adolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 were included in the present study. information on service use was based on adolescent self-report data collected in the youth@hordaland-survey. absence data was collected using administrative data provided by the hordaland county council. results: high absence (defined as being absent 15\% or more the past semester) was found among 10.1\% of the adolescents. compared to their peers with low absence (less than 3\% absence the past semester), adolescents with high absence were more likely to be in contact with all the services studied, including mental health services (odds ratio (or) 3.96), adolescent health clinics (or 2.11) and their general practitioner (gp) (or 1.94). frequency of contact was higher among adolescents with moderate and high absence and there seems to be a gradient of service use corresponding to the level of absence. still, 40\% of the adolescents with high absence had not been in contact with any services. conclusions: adolescents with high absence had increased use of services, although a group of youth at risk seems to be without such contact. this finding suggests a potential to address school absenteeism through systematic collaboration between schools and health personnel.},
