 abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the psychometric properties of the crafft-questionnaire, and its concurrent validity with self-reported measures of alcohol consumption and illicit drug use ever among norwegian adolescents. this study employs data from the ung@hordaland survey (n=9680). the concurrent validity of the crafft-questionnaire was examined both as a case-finder with different cut-offs, but also as an ordinal scale. the ordinal scale was constructed by counting the number of affirmative responses from 0 to 6. current self-reported excessive alcohol consumption, frequent binge drinking and any illicit drug use ever were employed as concurrent validity measures. the internal reliability of crafft was adequate, and there was a linear relationship between crafft-score and excessive alcohol consumption, frequent binge drinking and illicit drug use ever for both genders. overall, this study shows a good concurrent validity and adequate psychometric properties of the crafft-questionnaire. there results indicate, however, that the use of crafft as a case-finder needs further research, as a suitable cut-point was difficult to determine. the authors conclude that in a clinical setting one positive answer is enough to warrant further investigation, and for research purposes the use of the questionnaire as an ordinal scale or using a cut-point of 2 might be preferable. © 2013 elsevier ltd.},
