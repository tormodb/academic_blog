Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the ‘alcohol harm paradox’. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed.MethodsEmploying data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.","tags":null,"title":"Sociodemographic characteristics associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences, a latent class analysis of The Norwegian WIRUS screening study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annett Arntzen","Tormod Bøe","Espen Dahl","Nina Drange","Terje A Eikemo","Jon Ivar Elstad","Elisabeth Fosse","Steinar Krokstad","Astri Syse","Mira Aaboen Sletten","Bjorn Heine Strand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1e80a14eb343ff58a585651b398f641d","permalink":"/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.287511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced.

By proposing action on the social determinants of health such as affordable child-care, education, living environments and income structures, we aim to facilitate a possible re-orientation of policy away from redistribution to universalism. The striking challenges of the causes of health differences are complex, and the 29 recommendations to combat social inequality of health demand cross sectorial actions.

Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents’ participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A ‘never poor’ (89.3%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0%) or out (4.6%) of poverty, and a final ‘chronically poor’ (3.1%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.","tags":["adolescence","alcohol use","substance use","economic circumstances","economic volatility","relative poverty"],"title":"Economic Circumstances in Childhood and Subsequent Substance Use in Adolescence – A Latent Class Analysis: The youth@hordaland Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe","Keith J Petrie","Børge Sivertsen","Mari Hysing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e35559b0a130cd3d56e08293cf8b2446","permalink":"/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.284695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interplay of Subjective and Objective Economic Well-Being on the Mental Health of Norwegian Adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"273d9fbe645163d94b3f290d46e174ef","permalink":"/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.285956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["⛔ no doi found"],"title":"Road to Independence: Mental health  problems in unaccompanied refugee  minors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ingrid Kvestad","Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"1368954ff2cb42b477528487856961e0","permalink":"/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.290553Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"«Veien til Selvstendighet» er et samarbeidsprosjekt mellom Barneverntjenesten for Enslige Mindreårige Flyktninger i Bergen kommune og Regionalt Kunnskapssenter for Barn og Unge, NORCE Norwegian Research Centre.

In the Norwegian youth@hordaland study, 9166 16–19-year-olds provided information on perceived economic well-being and relevant covariates. Information about families’ income-to-needs was obtained from tax return forms. Adolescents in households with a low income-to-needs ratio, with non-working parents, and in single-parent households were more likely to report poor PEWB. Adolescents with poor PEWB reported more symptoms of depression and ADHD, also after adjusting for covariates, including income-to-needs. There was a significant indirect effect of income-to-needs on mental health problems though PEWB. The current study demonstrates the role of PEWB as a contributor in the pathway from social inequalities to disparities in mental health.","tags":null,"title":"Subjective Economic Status in Adolescence: Determinants and Associations with Mental Health in the Norwegian Youth@Hordaland Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Øystein Hetlevik","Tormod Bøe","Mari Hysing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"daec7366aa03b902ab90cf42ea351050","permalink":"/publication/hetlevik-g-pdiagnosedinternalizingexternalizing-2018/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:39:11.830386Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hetlevik-g-pdiagnosedinternalizingexternalizing-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"AbstractBackground.

In a hospital-based population of school-aged children prenatally exposed to opiates and a number of illicit substances (n = 57), we evaluated mental health symptoms associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Questionnaire, revision IV (SNAP-IV) and the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) and compared the scores to a reference group which comprised children from the population-based Bergen Child Study (n = 171). Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention. In conclusion, prenatally exposed children had more mental health symptoms associated with ADHD and ASD, compared with the reference group.","tags":null,"title":"Symptoms Associated With Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorders in School-Aged Children Prenatally Exposed to Substances","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe","Anna Sofia Serlachius","Børge Sivertsen","Keith J.
