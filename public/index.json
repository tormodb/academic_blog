Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the ‘alcohol harm paradox’. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed.MethodsEmploying data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.","tags":null,"title":"Sociodemographic characteristics associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences, a latent class analysis of The Norwegian WIRUS screening study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annett Arntzen","Tormod Bøe","Espen Dahl","Nina Drange","Terje A Eikemo","Jon Ivar Elstad","Elisabeth Fosse","Steinar Krokstad","Astri Syse","Mira Aaboen Sletten","Bjorn Heine Strand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1e80a14eb343ff58a585651b398f641d","permalink":"https://tormod.netlify.com/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.287511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced.

Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents’ participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A ‘never poor’ (89.3%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0%) or out (4.6%) of poverty, and a final ‘chronically poor’ (3.1%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.","tags":["adolescence","alcohol use","substance use","economic circumstances","economic volatility","relative poverty"],"title":"Economic Circumstances in Childhood and Subsequent Substance Use in Adolescence – A Latent Class Analysis: The youth@hordaland Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe","Keith J Petrie","Børge Sivertsen","Mari Hysing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e35559b0a130cd3d56e08293cf8b2446","permalink":"https://tormod.netlify.com/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.284695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interplay of Subjective and Objective Economic Well-Being on the Mental Health of Norwegian Adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"273d9fbe645163d94b3f290d46e174ef","permalink":"https://tormod.netlify.com/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.285956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["⛔ no doi found"],"title":"Road to Independence: Mental health  problems in unaccompanied refugee  minors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ingrid Kvestad","Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"1368954ff2cb42b477528487856961e0","permalink":"https://tormod.netlify.com/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.290553Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"«Veien til Selvstendighet» er et samarbeidsprosjekt mellom Barneverntjenesten for Enslige Mindreårige Flyktninger i Bergen kommune og Regionalt Kunnskapssenter for Barn og Unge, NORCE Norwegian Research Centre.

Information about families’ income-to-needs was obtained from tax return forms. Adolescents in households with a low income-to-needs ratio, with non-working parents, and in single-parent households were more likely to report poor PEWB. Adolescents with poor PEWB reported more symptoms of depression and ADHD, also after adjusting for covariates, including income-to-needs. There was a significant indirect effect of income-to-needs on mental health problems though PEWB.

Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention.

We expected there to be a higher frequency of negative life-evetns and curent family stressors in families with a poor economy, and were interested in investigating whethre the influence of such circumstances interacted with poor family economy, to produce a cumulative infliuence on their rate of mental health problems .\n measruring cumulative adversity in a recent publication (evans, 2013, psych bull) several approaches to measruring cumulative the disadvantage to risk n is reviwed, and, despite several limitations, it is concluded that a cumulative risk approach (dichotomizing and adding together specific indicators of risk) is favorable compared to other approaches such as summary scores, factor scores and other approaches that previously has been used to combine information about risk factors in studies of cumulative risk. See also () for examples of studies comparing different approaches.\nEvans (2013) further recommends several potential extensions of the CR approach such as a) creating domain specific risks and assessing their interactions, b) checking for nonlinearity in the association with outcomes, and c) assessing total CR in combination with specific riskfactors in order to investigate whether a single risk factor is responsible for the majority of influence of the CR.\n defining risk temporal issues mediation additivity CR domains and interactions/additivity between these domains  what domains are viable? see online table 3 of Evans paper for suggestions about domains (proximity/distality), individual/social    Measuring risk in the current study Simple cumulative risk approach - then check for interaction with family economy?
