This post has simply been a personal exercise in webscraping data that others have made available. I am also personally curious to see the correspondence between the observed numbers of patients being hospitalized and in ICU and the predictions given the different RE-estimates produced.\n This project uses daily updates about patients hospitalized and in ICU scraped from the Norwegian Directorate of Health in tandem with the predictions from the report “Covid-19 epidemic: Risk assessment and response in Norway”1 published by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) building on modelling conducted by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team.\nI have resorted to web-scraping as I have not been able to find suitable data published online. Please advice if you now of any open datasources containing this information!\nThe figure plots the daily number of observed cases (the red dot) on the timeline of predictions from the report from the NPHI (the red, green and blue lines represent trajectories predicted from different REs). This far, the observed numbers are lagging behind the predictions and will only be in sync from March 30th and onwards.\nNote. The report from the NIPH provided numeric estimates (with confidence intervals) for the dates March 23rd (observed data), March 30th, April 6th and April 13th. The data in between these dates is based on a linear prediction based on the trends from the estimates between these dates.

It does the scraping and stores results to two csv-files. The script is sourced by this post, to keep it updated and the resulting csv files are read into this script and used to produce the graphs. For now, this requires a manual update of the script to keep it current, and I have not investigated options to make the script self-updated, which could probably be achieved with shiny or other options. The script to do this is very fragile; It depends on the Norwegian Directorate of Health keeping the address to their site and even the wording on their site exactly similar from day to day, I have already had to update it due to the Norwegian Directorate of Health adding an extra space (\" \") in front of the number of ICU patients on March 29th thus breaking the method of using strsplit and retrieving the object from a specific position (which shifted the number is wanted from position [14] to position [15].

Oversikt over publikasjoner, fordelt på kategori vil kunne hentes fra referanseverktøy (som støtter BibTeX formatet) Publikasjoner som skal inkluderes i Track record vil kunne markeres i referanseverktøyet, og settes inn automatisk.  Du vil trenge følgende programvare installert på din maskin:  R, med følgende bibliotek2:\n library(tidyverse) library(vitae) library(flextable) library(readxl) library(dplyr) library(RefManageR)    RStudio (anbefales på det sterkeste)\n Referanseverktøy som søtter BibTeX eksport, jeg anbefaler Zotero, og for automatisk oppdatert bibtex export trenger du også Better BibTeX\n  I tillegg trenger du følgende filer:\n cv-word.Rmd (dokumenter som lager selve CVen) cv-nfr_style.docx (stildokumentet som gir ferdig formatering) en BibTeX-fil (med dine egne referanser) et Excel-ark (som inneholder undervisnings- og formidlingserfaring)  Alle disse filene kan du laste ned fra mitt github repositorie, men du må tilpasse og gjøre endringer i innholdet for å tilpasse dette til din egen CV, se instruksjoner under.\n Første steg - Test programmene Etter å ha installert R, RStudio og bibliotekene over, kan du last ned filene fra mitt github repositorie til en egen mappe på din maskin. Dersom du åpner filen cv-word.Rmd i RStudio og trykker Knit -\u0026gt; Knit to Word skal du få et Word dokument som ser ut som filen cv-word_static.docx, som illustrert under.\n         Andre steg - Koble til din egen Google Scholar profil Du vil trenge din profil-id fra Google Scholar. Denne finner du innebygget i lenken til din Google Scholar profil. Lenken til min profilside er https://scholar-google-com.pva.uib.no/citations?user=TMC38ZgAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl=en, og min profil-id er da strengen TMC38ZgAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl som du finner mot slutten av lenken mellom user= og =en. Tilkoblingen til Google Scholar brukes for å hente ut totalt antall siteringer, h-indeks og i10-indeks3.\nInformasjon om profil legges inn i linje 20 i cv-word.Rmd-filen:\n# Personalization for Google Scholar id \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;TMC38ZgAAAAJ\u0026#39; # Google Scholar ID.  Tredje steg - Legg til formidling Jeg dokumenter min formidlings- og foredragsvirksomhet i et regneark. I arket fører jeg opp år, måned, tittel, arrangement, arrangør og antall deltagere. Hvis du følger samme malen som i regnearket du lastet ned vil formidlingsaktiviteten med periode (fra første til siste årstall), antall arrangement og antall deltagere inkluderes i CVen. Excelarket kan også være utgangspunkt for en full oversikt over formidlingsaktiviteter, se for eksempel min pedagogiske portefølje.\n Fjerde steg - Publikasjonsliste Jeg anbefaler jeg deg å ha dine egne akademiske publikasjoner i et referansehåndteringsverktøy, som for andre referanser du bruker i ditt arbeid. Jeg bruker Zotero. Det finnes valg for å legge inn de fleste typer akademiske referanser, artikler, bøker og kapitler, konferansebidrag, intervjuer osv.\nFor deg som bruker Zotero (eller vurderer å gjøre det) Du kan enkelt hente ut en BibTeX-fil med dine publikasjoner fra Google Scholar. Scholar har fokus på artikler i tidsskrift, så det er veldig mange andre former for akademiske publikasjoner som ikke blir indeksert her. De som ikke finnes i Google Scholar må du legge til manuelt, men om du gjør det i et referansehåndteringsverktøy slipper du å gjøre denne jobben mange ganger, kun oppdatere og legge til nye publikasjoner, konferansepresentasjoner, etc.\nEksporter en .bib fil med dine referanser fra Google Scholar Importer denne til Zotero Lag en undersamling i Zotero med dine egne referanser Bruk Better BibTeX for å eksportere denne til en fil i BibTeX-format, velg et filnavn som er forståelig, og velg å eksportere til mappen hvor du planlegger å ha de andre filene til din CV.  Better BibTeX Better BibTeX er en plug-in til Zotero som automatisk eksporterer (og holder oppdatert) et bibliotek fra Zotero til BibTeX formatet. Du kan da lage en undersamling i Zotero som inneholder dine egne publikasjoner, og når du legger til nye referanser i denne samlingen vil de da også eksporteres til en oppdatert BibTeX fil, og med systemet som beskrives her vil den da også legges til i din CV4. Fordelen fremfor f.eks. Endnote og Mendeley (som også kan eksportere til BibTeX) er at med Zotero og Better BibTeX vil filen holdes oppdatert autmatisk, og, ikke minst, BibTeX koden er korrekt (Mendeley gjør en dårlig jobb med å eksportere til BibTeX).\n   Femte steg - Utvalgte publikasjoner i Track Record Målet ditt her er å legge til informasjon i referansebiblioteket ditt som gjør det mulig å filtrere ut de (inntil) 10 publikasjonene som du ønsker å fremheve i din Track Record. Jeg synes det er enklest å bruke BibTeX/feltet ids til dette. Her gir du publikasjonene dine nummer fra 1-10, og det enkleste er om du gir verdi etter rekkefølgen du ønsker at publikasjonene skal vises på CVen; 1 til den du vil vise først i listen, 2 til den neste, osv. til 10 som blir den siste.\nFor deg som bruker Zotero eller vurderer å gjøre det Feltet ids er ikke skrivbart fra Zotero. Metoden jeg bruker er å benytte “Ekstra” feltet som er nederst i informasjon om referansen i Info vinduet i Zotero. Der kan du sette inn følgende tekst Citation Key Alias: 1...10 for eksempel Citation Key Alias: 3 for referansen du ønsker skal være nummer tre av ti i din Track Record. Når du eksporterer med Better BibTeX blir dette nummeret lagt til i feltet ids.\n Manuell metode for deg som ikke bruker Zotero En enkelt referanse i .bib-filen din ser f.eks. slik ut:\n@article{BoeInterplaySubjectiveObjective2019a,\nids = {3}, \u0026lt;- Dette feltet må legges til.\ntitle = {Interplay of {{Subjective}} and {{Objective Economic Well}}-{{Being}} on the {{Mental Health}} of {{Norwegian Adolescents}}},\nauthor = {Bøe, Tormod and Petrie, Keith J and Sivertsen, Børge and Hysing, Mari},\ndate = {2019},\njournaltitle = {SSM - Popul. Health},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100471}\n}\nLegg merke til feltet ids={3} på andre linje over. Dette betyr at denne referansen vil komme som tredje artikkel på listen i din Track Record. I .bib-filen din må du altså sette inn ids={1...10}, for de referansene du ønsker å inkludere. Husk også kommaet etter siste krøllparentes!\n    Du er selv ansvarlig for at CV som skal leveres ved søknader følger malen til Norges Forskningsråd.

Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the ‘alcohol harm paradox’. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems. Next, the associations between sub-groups characterized by different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems, and age, gender, educational level, full-time employment, occupational level and income is analysed.MethodsEmploying data from the ongoing cross-sectional WIRUS-study, N = 4311 participants were included in the present study. Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.","tags":null,"title":"Sociodemographic characteristics associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences, a latent class analysis of The Norwegian WIRUS screening study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annett Arntzen","Tormod Bøe","Espen Dahl","Nina Drange","Terje A Eikemo","Jon Ivar Elstad","Elisabeth Fosse","Steinar Krokstad","Astri Syse","Mira Aaboen Sletten","Bjorn Heine Strand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"1e80a14eb343ff58a585651b398f641d","permalink":"https://tormodboe.netlify.com/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.287511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arntzen-29-recommendationscombat-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced.

Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents’ participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A ‘never poor’ (89.3%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0%) or out (4.6%) of poverty, and a final ‘chronically poor’ (3.1%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.","tags":["adolescence","alcohol use","substance use","economic circumstances","economic volatility","relative poverty"],"title":"Economic Circumstances in Childhood and Subsequent Substance Use in Adolescence – A Latent Class Analysis: The youth@hordaland Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe","Keith J Petrie","Børge Sivertsen","Mari Hysing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"e35559b0a130cd3d56e08293cf8b2446","permalink":"https://tormodboe.netlify.com/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.284695Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-interplay-subjective-objective-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Interplay of Subjective and Objective Economic Well-Being on the Mental Health of Norwegian Adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"273d9fbe645163d94b3f290d46e174ef","permalink":"https://tormodboe.netlify.com/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.285956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/boe-road-independence-mental-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["⛔ no doi found"],"title":"Road to Independence: Mental health  problems in unaccompanied refugee  minors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ingrid Kvestad","Tormod Bøe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"1368954ff2cb42b477528487856961e0","permalink":"https://tormodboe.netlify.com/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-22T21:44:43.290553Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kvestadveientil-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"«Veien til Selvstendighet» er et samarbeidsprosjekt mellom Barneverntjenesten for Enslige Mindreårige Flyktninger i Bergen kommune og Regionalt Kunnskapssenter for Barn og Unge, NORCE Norwegian Research Centre.

Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention.

We expected there to be a higher frequency of negative life-evetns and curent family stressors in families with a poor economy, and were interested in investigating whethre the influence of such circumstances interacted with poor family economy, to produce a cumulative infliuence on their rate of mental health problems .\n measruring cumulative adversity in a recent publication (evans, 2013, psych bull) several approaches to measruring cumulative the disadvantage to risk n is reviwed, and, despite several limitations, it is concluded that a cumulative risk approach (dichotomizing and adding together specific indicators of risk) is favorable compared to other approaches such as summary scores, factor scores and other approaches that previously has been used to combine information about risk factors in studies of cumulative risk. See also () for examples of studies comparing different approaches.\nEvans (2013) further recommends several potential extensions of the CR approach such as a) creating domain specific risks and assessing their interactions, b) checking for nonlinearity in the association with outcomes, and c) assessing total CR in combination with specific riskfactors in order to investigate whether a single risk factor is responsible for the majority of influence of the CR.\n defining risk temporal issues mediation additivity CR domains and interactions/additivity between these domains  what domains are viable? see online table 3 of Evans paper for suggestions about domains (proximity/distality), individual/social    Measuring risk in the current study Simple cumulative risk approach - then check for interaction with family economy?
