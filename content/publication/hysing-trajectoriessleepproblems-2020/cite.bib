 abstract = {Study objective
The aim of the study is to assess stability and predictors of insomnia and sleep duration from adolescence to early adulthood.
Methods
A longitudinal sample of 1257 individuals from three age cohorts were assessed from linked population-based studies, the youth@hordaland study from 2012 (age 16–18) and the SHoT2018 study (age 22–25). Identical measures of insomnia symptoms and sleep duration were analysed.
Results
The stability of insomnia was high from adolescence to young adulthood, 50% of those with insomnia symptoms in adolescence still had insomnia symptoms six years later (adjusted IRR = 2.01; (CI 95%; 1.5–2.44)). Short sleep duration was also stable, with 67.8% of the adolescents in the lowest sleep duration quartile still remaining in the lowest quartile six years later. The overall rate of insomnia symptoms, long wake after sleep onset (WASO), and oversleeping increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Also, we observed a reduction in sleep efficiency and later rise times. There was no significant change in sleep onset latency (SOL).
Conclusion
Insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration are prevalent during both adolescence and young adulthood. Considerable individual stability and a rising rate of insomnia symptoms were observed over time. These findings underscore the importance of early identification and timely interventions to prevent chronic sleep problems.},
