abstract: Physical activity in adolescence is found to promote both immediate and
  long-term health, as well as school- and work performance. Previous studies suggest
  that parental socioeconomic status (SES) may influence the level of activity, although
  the results are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to examine the overall
  level of low physical activity/sports participation and the associations with parental
  SES and adolescent school program in a population-based study of older adolescents.
