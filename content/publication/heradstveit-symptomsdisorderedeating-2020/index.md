abstract: Aim This study aimed to investigate individual and team sports participation
  across sex, age, and levels of body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to explore
  how symptoms of disordered eating (DE) were associated with participation in individual
  and team sports, and to what extent BMI moderated this association. Methods Data
  stemmed from a large population-based survey of 10,172 Norwegian adolescents aged
  16 to 19 years. Self-reported participation in organized team- and individual sports
  were the dependent variables. Self-reported symptoms of DE using the five-item Eating
  Disturbance Screening (EDS-5) questionnaire comprised the independent variable.
  Covariates included sex, age, socioeconomic status, and BMI. We used regression
  analyses for associations between DE symptoms and sports participation, including
  the interaction between DE and BMI. Results Boys had higher team sports participation
  compared with girls. Individual and team sports participation varied significantly
  across BMI levels for each sex. Symptoms of DE were negatively associated with team
  sports participation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, p textless 0.001), and were not significantly
  associated with individual sports participation. BMI scores moderated the association
  between DE symptoms and individual sports participation (p textless 0.005). DE symptoms
  were associated with higher individual sports participation among individuals with
  low BMI, and with lower participation among those with high BMI. Conclusions DE
  symptoms are important correlates of sports participation among adolescents, but
  the direction of these associations partly differs across the weight spectrum. Promotion
  of factors that counteract DE is needed alongside efforts to increase physical activity
  and sports participation in the general adolescent population.
