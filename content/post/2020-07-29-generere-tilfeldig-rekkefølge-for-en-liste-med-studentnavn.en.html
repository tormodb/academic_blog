<h1>R script to generate random numbers merged with a list of student names retrieved from Canvas</h1>
<p>My students have to choose where they want to have their internship in societal psychology. Since some internships seems to be more popular, I make a random list of numbers from <code>1:number of students</code> which I then merge with the list of student names retrieved from Canvas. This then becomes the order in which the students select their internships.</p>
<p>Since I do this twice per semester every year, I made this (highly overengineered) solution using R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load libraries
require(tidyverse) # For data management
require(rcanvas)   # To connect to Canvas
require(openxlsx)  # To output to MS Excel
require(readr)     # To output to csv</code></pre>
<div id="get-userinfo-for-specific-course" class="section level2">
<h2>Get userinfo for specific course</h2>
<p>You will need to input the id for the specific course you want to retrieve student info from. I have added a <code>YOURID</code> placeholder to indicate where this has to be entered. See my previous post for how to retrieve all your Canvas courses, and for how to search that list for a specific course. You will also have to add your Canvas access token and the correct server before you can continue. This was described in my previous post.</p>
<p>The <code>rcanvas::get_course_items()</code> functions has options to get only the students, but in my case this does not retrieve their email addresses. I therefore retrive all users in the course, then the students, and then merge the email address with the students names using <code>dplyr::inner_join()</code>.</p>
<p>If you require it, you also have a simple way of making a list with the same information for teachers using a <code>dplyr::anti_join()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get info for all users Canvas
list_of_users &lt;- get_course_items(
  course_id = YOURID, item = &quot;users&quot;, include = &quot;email&quot;
  )      

# Get only students, but no email so we must merge 
list_of_students &lt;- get_course_items(
  course_id = YOURID, item = &quot;students&quot;, include = &quot;email&quot;
  ) 

# Merge in the email adress
students_with_email &lt;- dplyr::inner_join(list_of_students, 
                                         select(list_of_users, login_id, email), 
                                         by = &quot;login_id&quot;, copy = F
                                         )  
# Need a list of teachers as well?
# teachers_with_email &lt;- dplyr::anti_join(
#   list_of_users, list_of_students, by = &quot;id&quot;
#   )</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="generate-the-random-numbers" class="section level2">
<h2>Generate the random numbers</h2>
<pre class="r"><code># Generate a random number from 1:the number of students
draw_order &lt;- sample(1: length(students_with_email$name), length(students_with_email$name)) 

# Merge the random string of numbers with the dataframe containing student info
students_with_email_number &lt;- cbind(students_with_email, draw_order) 

# Order the lsit of students by their placement in the draw
students_with_email_number &lt;- students_with_email_number %&gt;% arrange(draw_order)  </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="save-the-resulting-data-frame-to-excel-and-csv." class="section level2">
<h2>Save the resulting data frame to Excel and csv.</h2>
<p>Since I will publish this list back to Canvas, I only retain the name of the students and their placement in the draw in the files that I store. I use <code>dplyr::select()</code> to keep only these two variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># as xls
students_with_email_number %&gt;% 
  select(name, draw_order) %&gt;%    
  openxlsx::write.xlsx(., &quot;yourfile.xlsx&quot;)                                             

# as csv
students_with_email_number %&gt;% 
  select(name, draw_order) %&gt;%    
  readr::write_csv(., &quot;yourfile.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
