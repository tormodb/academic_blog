Auxillary files can be placed in the `content` folder, i.e. `aux` and linked to in yaml header: 

```{r, eval=F}
csl: aux/apa.csl
css: aux/APAStyle.css
keep_md: yes
bibliography: aux/lifeevents.bib
```

rmarkdown will then use this to produce html file in `public/post` folder. At least bibtex file, not so sure about css though...
