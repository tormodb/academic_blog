<p>The best way to do this now is to follow the guide on the following <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-publication">page</a>.</p>

<p>I tried to build markdown files to use for publication section of my blog programmatically using r. I came close, but not all the way there.</p>
<p>The following code takes a bibtex file, reads it into r, formats the output and splits each citation out to a separate markdown file. Unfortunately, there were som spaces and formatting errors that I was not able to get rid of, so I had to go through some manual cleaning up afterwards.</p>
<p>The goal was to get pretty close to this yaml result, as I am using the setup from Rob Hyndman’s excellent site, which he has shared on github.</p>

<p>I did this two times, the second time adding some extra fields…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yamllist2 &lt;- list()

  slu &lt;- paste0(&quot;slug: &quot;, paste(bib$BIBTEXKEY[[i]]))

  pub &lt;- paste(&quot;kind:&quot;, &quot;  published&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)
  name &lt;- paste0(&quot;article&quot;, i, sep = &#39;&#39;)
  abst &lt;- paste0(bib$ABSTRACT[[i]])
  tmp2 &lt;- list(au=au, co =co, yr=yr,slu=slu, tit=tit , pub=pub, abst = abst, date = date)
  yamllist2[[name]] &lt;- tmp2
}</code></pre>
<p>This loop prints out the markdown files into the <code>publications</code> folder in my <code>blogdown</code> project.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:length(yamllist)) {
  cat(paste0(&quot;---&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;),
      paste0(unlist(yamllist[i]), sep = &quot;\n&quot;), 
      paste0(&quot;---&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;), 
      paste0(&quot;\n&quot;, yamllist2[[i]]$abst, sep = &quot;\n&quot;), file = paste0(&quot;content/publications/&quot;, yamllist2[[i]]$date, &quot;-01-01-&quot;, names(yamllist)[i], &quot;.md&quot;))
}</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get rid of the spacing before the final “—” in the YAML output, nor the spacings before the yaml fields title, author etc. I had to reopen the files in atom - for ease - and did a manual removal there. For files that did not work directly, I also used the “Update Metadata” adding from <code>bookdown</code>. Took a while, but still a lot less than manually copying and pasting this information from the web or reference manager would have done.</p>
