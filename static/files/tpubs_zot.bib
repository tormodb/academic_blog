  abstract = {All political parties in Norway agree that social inequalities in health comprise a public health problem and should be reduced. Against this background, the Council on Social Inequalities in Health has taken action to provide specific advice to reduce social health differences.             Our recommendations focus on the entire social gradient rather than just poverty and the socially disadvantaged. By proposing action on the social determinants of health such as affordable child-care, education, living environments and income structures, we aim to facilitate a possible re-orientation of policy away from redistribution to universalism.             The striking challenges of the causes of health differences are complex, and the 29 recommendations to combat social inequality of health demand cross sectorial actions. The recommendations are listed thematically and have not been prioritized. Some are fundamental and require pronounced changes across sectors, whereas others are minor and sector-specific.},

The study is based on the youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Western Norway in 2012. A total of 9157 adolescents (aged 16\textendash 19 years, 53\% girls) consented to participation and registry linkage and comprised the sample of the present study. Symptoms of depression, ADHD, and conduct disorder were based on adolescent self-report.

In the sample, 14.8\% had not completed upper secondary education within 5 years. Symptoms of depression were associated with higher odds of failure to graduate within 5 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\,=\,1.50). The association was attenuated but remained significant when adjusting for symptoms of ADHD, conduct disorder, and parental education. Adolescents reporting high levels of both depression and conduct disorder had the highest odds of dropout (AOR\,=\,4.15). GPA partially mediated the association between symptoms of depression and dropout. The results show a consistent, but small association between symptoms of depression in late adolescence and failure to complete upper secondary education within five years. Given the high rate of depressive symptoms in the adolescent population, it is important to identify protective factors that promote school functioning and graduation for adolescents experiencing such symptoms.},

The main aim of the present study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and school absence in late adolescence, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and externalizing problems. Methods Data stem from the youth@hordaland-survey, a population-based survey of adolescents between 16 and 19 years old attending upper secondary education in Hordaland County, Norway, in spring 2012. Administrative data on school absence was provided for 8222 adolescents. In additions to days and hours absent the past semester, a variable of total absence was calculated and divided into quartiles of absence. Symptoms of mental health problems and sleep duration was based on adolescent self-reports. Results Reports of depressive symptoms was significantly associated with school absence when investigated as continuous variables. The strength of the association attenuated but remained statistically significant when controlling for sociodemographic factors and externalizing problems. When investigating the association at different levels of school absence, adolescents in the second, third and fourth quartile of school absence reported significantly higher depression scores compared to adolescents in the first quartile. The association between reports of symptoms of depression and school absence was partially mediated by sleep duration. Conclusion The association between reported symptoms of depression and school absence was evident even at low levels of school absence, indicating a role for universal prevention strategies. The findings suggest both depression and sleep problems as possible targets for intervention in late adolescence.},

This study aimed to investigate the association between negative life events and depressive symptoms among adolescents, and to examine the influence and relative contributions of personal, social and family protective factors related to resilience. Methods Data stem from the cross-sectional youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Hordaland, Norway. In all, 9,546 adolescents, aged 16\textendash 19 years old (52.8\% girls) provided self-report information on depressive symptoms, negative life events and protective factors related to resilience. Results Experiencing a higher number of negative life events was related to increases in depressive symptoms, while the potential protective factors goal orientation, self-confidence, social competence, social support, and family cohesion individually were associated with fewer symptoms. Although there were small moderating effects of goal orientation and self-confidence, the results mainly supported a compensatory resilience model. When considering the potential protective factors jointly, only self-confidence and family cohesion were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms for both genders, with the addition of social support for girls. There were significant interactions between all the potential protective factors and gender, indicating a greater reduction of depressive symptoms with higher levels of protective factors among girls. Conclusions Interventions aimed at fostering self-confidence and family cohesion could be effective in preventing depressive symptoms for adolescent boys and girls, regardless of their exposure to negative events. Results further indicate that preventive interventions targeting these potential protective factors could be especially beneficial for adolescent girls.},

This study aimed to investigate equity in Norwegian adolescents' use of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) with regards to parental education levels, using a survey of 10\,257 Norwegian 16- to 19-year-olds subsequently linked to CAMHS data from the Norwegian Patient Registry (n\,=\,970 had been in contact with CAMHS). Analyses using concentration indices (C) suggested adolescents with parents with lower education levels had more mental health problems (ie, larger need; C\,=\,-0.032, P\,{$<$}\,.001) and were more in contact with CAMHS (C\,=\,-0.025, P\,{$<$}\,.001). Regression analysis suggested that CAMHS contact, and number of unique admissions was largely distributed according to need, but participants whose parents had basic education levels were in contact with CAMHS for slightly longer than predicted from their self-reported mental health problems, age, and sex. Results from this study suggested that contact with CAMHS was largely equitable and mostly influenced by need. There was little evidence of parental education-related inequity in access to, and use of, specialized mental health services.},

  abstract = {Youth mental health problems is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major public health concern. Prevalence rates are needed for planning preventive interventions and health care services. We here report Norwegian prevalence estimates for youth mental disorders based on findings from the Bergen Child Study cohort. A web-based psychiatric interview; the Development and Well-Being Assessment, was completed by parents and teachers of 2,043 10-14-year-olds from the city of Bergen, Norway. Post-stratification weights were used to account for selective participation related to parental educational in the estimation of prevalence rates. Prevalence rates are presented for the whole sample and stratified by gender and age. The overall population weighted estimate suggests that 6.93\% (95\% CI 5.06\textendash 9.41) of the children met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. There were no robust indications of age- or gender-related differences in the prevalence. 11.4\% of the children fulfilled criteria for more than one diagnosis. The most common comorbid conditions were ADHD and disruptive disorders. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was relatively low among Norwegian 10-14-year-olds, compared to published worldwide prevalence estimates. This is in line with estimates from prior studies from the Nordic countries. These findings raise important questions about the origins of different prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders between societies. The findings also illustrate the importance of locally driven epidemiological studies for planning preventative efforts and appropriately scaling mental health services to meet the need of the population.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: It is generally accepted that mental health problems are unequally distributed across population strata defined by socioeconomic status (SES), with more problems for those with lower SES. However, studies of this association in children and adolescents are often restricted by the use of global measures of mental health problems and aggregation of SES-indicators. We aim to further elucidate the relationship between childhood mental health problems and SES by including more detailed information about mental health and individual SES-indicators. METHODS: The participants (N = 5,781, age 11-13) were part of the Bergen Child Study (BCS). Mental health was assessed using the teacher, parent and self-report versions of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), including an impact section, used to measure symptom dimensions and probability of psychiatric disorders. Parent reports of family economy and parental education were used as SES measures. RESULTS: For each SES indicator we confirmed an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Poor family economy consistently predicted mental health problems, while parental education level predicted externalizing disorders stronger than internalizing disorders. CONCLUSION: In this Norwegian sample of children, family economy was a significant predictor of mental health problems as measured across a wide range of symptom dimensions and poor economy predicted a high probability of a psychiatric disorder. Longitudinal studies of the impact of low family income as well as other SES factors on externalizing and internalizing symptom dimensions and disorders are called for.},

Information about families' income-to-needs was obtained from tax return forms.

Adolescents with poor PEWB reported more symptoms of depression and ADHD, also after adjusting for covariates, including income-to-needs. There was a significant indirect effect of income-to-needs on mental health problems though PEWB.

  abstract = {Aims:The literature on associations between internalising problems and subsequent alcohol/drug use and problems shows mixed results, and it is important to consider different aspects of internalising problems along with co-occurring externalising problems.Methods:In a longitudinal study (n = 2438) followed up when the subjects were 7?9, 11?13, and 16?19 years of age, we investigated associations between parent/teacher-reported externalising and internalising problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) and adolescent self-reported alcohol and illicit drug use and problems. Socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and age were included as potential confounding variables. We also adjusted for the potential confounding effects from externalising problems on the association between internalising problems and alcohol/drug use, and vice versa.Results:Externalising problems were positively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use and problems (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] ranging from 1.24 to 1.40, all p {$<$} .05), while internalising problems were negatively associated with all measures of alcohol/drug use (AORs ranging 0.83 to 0.88, all p {$<$} .05). Full-scale SDQ externalising problems were somewhat stronger and more robust predictors of adolescent alcohol/drug-related problems compared with SDQ externalising subscales, while only full-scale SDQ internalising problems were negatively associated with alcohol/drug-related problems. All estimates were similar across genders.Conclusions:Childhood externalising problems are positively associated while internalising problems are negatively associated with alcohol/drug use and problems in late adolescence.},

  abstract = {Aim This study aimed to investigate individual and team sports participation across sex, age, and levels of body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to explore how symptoms of disordered eating (DE) were associated with participation in individual and team sports, and to what extent BMI moderated this association. Methods Data stemmed from a large population-based survey of 10,172 Norwegian adolescents aged 16 to 19~years. Self-reported participation in organized team- and individual sports were the dependent variables. Self-reported symptoms of DE using the five-item Eating Disturbance Screening (EDS-5) questionnaire comprised the independent variable. Covariates included sex, age, socioeconomic status, and BMI. We used regression analyses for associations between DE symptoms and sports participation, including the interaction between DE and BMI. Results Boys had higher team sports participation compared with girls. Individual and team sports participation varied significantly across BMI levels for each sex. Symptoms of DE were negatively associated with team sports participation (odds ratio [OR]~=~0.90, p~{$<~$}0.001), and were not significantly associated with individual sports participation. BMI scores moderated the association between DE symptoms and individual sports participation (p~{$<~$}0.005). DE symptoms were associated with higher individual sports participation among individuals with low BMI, and with lower participation among those with high BMI. Conclusions DE symptoms are important correlates of sports participation among adolescents, but the direction of these associations partly differs across the weight spectrum. Promotion of factors that counteract DE is needed alongside efforts to increase physical activity and sports participation in the general adolescent population.},

  abstract = {Background: Loneliness is a major public health concern among college and university students, the evidence is inconsistent regarding whether there is an increasing trend or not. Furthermore, knowledge of the demographic determinants for loneliness are limited. The present study assesses recent trends of loneliness from 2014 to 2018, and explores demographic risk indicators of loneliness among students. Method: Data was drawn from two waves of a national student health survey from 2014 and 2018 for higher education in Norway (the SHoT-study). In 2018, all 162,512 fulltime students in Norway were invited to participate and 50,054 students (69.1\% women) aged 18-35 years were included (response rate = 30.8\%). Loneliness was measured by ``The Three-Item Loneliness Scale'' (T-ILS) and one item from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25). Results: Age showed a curvilinear association with loneliness, with the youngest and oldest students reporting the highest level of loneliness across all measures. Other significant demographic determinants of loneliness were being female, single and living alone. There was a considerable increase in loneliness from 2014 (16.5\%) to 2018 (23.6\%, p \&amp;lt; .001), and the increase was particularly strong for males, for whom the proportion of feeling ``extremely'' lonely had more than doubled. Conclusion: The high rate of loneliness and the increasing trends indicate the need for preventive interventions in the student population.},

Methods The data are drawn from the youth@hordaland study, a large population-based study conducted in 2012, linked with official educational data in Norway (N\,=\,8838). Results High school dropout was more prevalent among adolescents who had insomnia (20.6\%) compared to those without insomnia (14.3\%; adjusted risk ratios\,=\,1.50; 95\% confidence intervals: [2.19-2.92]). There was also a higher rate of school dropout among those who had symptoms of delayed sleep-wake phase (21\%) compared to those without delayed sleep-wake phase (14.3\%); adjusted risk ratios\,=\,1.43, 95\% confidence intervals: (1.28-1.59). School noncompleters were also characterized by reporting 44\,minutes shorter sleep duration, longer sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset (both approx. 15\,minutes)~compared to school completers. Conclusion The importance of sleep for high school dropout rates highlights the importance of including sleep as a risk indicator and a possible target for preventive interventions in late adolescence.},

  abstract = {Sleep problems are prevalent among adolescents, especially among those diagnosed with mental health disorders. There is insufficient knowledge about sleep among adolescents within child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in comparison to the general population. The data are drawn from the youth@hordaland study, a large population-based study conducted in 2012, linked to the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) (n\,=\,9077). Psychiatric disorders were based on clinical diagnoses from the NPR, while insomnia, delayed sleep\textendash wake-phase disorder (DSWPD), and other sleep problems/patterns were assessed by self-report questionnaires from youth@hordaland. The prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among adolescents seeking mental health services was 0.6\%, yielding an estimated prevalence of 0.07\% of the population. However, questionnaire-based measurement of insomnia from the youth@hordaland study indicated that insomnia was highly prevalent across disorders in comparison to a reference group of adolescents who were not within mental health care. Insomnia ranged from 29\% among adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (PR\,=\,1.79; 95\% CI 1.41\textendash 2.29) to 48\% among adolescents diagnosed with depression (PR\,=\,2.53, 95\% CI 2.19\textendash 2.92). All diagnostic groups had a mean sleep efficiency below (85\%), indicating poor sleep quality. Insomnia, delayed sleep-phase wake disorder, and poor sleep efficiency were confirmed as transdiagnostic sleep problems across psychiatric disorders. In addition, some disorder-specific patterns emerged, such as a higher prevalence of insomnia among adolescents with depression, and DSWPS among adolescents with conduct disorder. This underscores the need for treating sleep problems in CAMHS, and transdiagnostic treatment approaches are warranted.},

METHODS: A longitudinal sample of 1257 individuals from three age cohorts were assessed from linked population-based studies, the youth@hordaland study from 2012 (age 16-18) and the SHoT2018 study (age 22-25). Identical measures of insomnia symptoms and sleep duration were analysed. RESULTS: The stability of insomnia was high from adolescence to young adulthood, 50\% of those with insomnia symptoms in adolescence still had insomnia symptoms six years later (adjusted IRR~=~2.01; (CI 95\%; 1.5-2.44)). Short sleep duration was also stable, with 67.8\% of the adolescents in the lowest sleep duration quartile still remaining in the lowest quartile six years later. The overall rate of insomnia symptoms, long wake after sleep onset (WASO), and oversleeping increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Also, we observed a reduction in sleep efficiency and later rise times. There was no significant change in sleep onset latency (SOL). CONCLUSION: Insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration are prevalent during both adolescence and young adulthood. Considerable individual stability and a rising rate of insomnia symptoms were observed over time. These findings underscore the importance of early identification and timely interventions to prevent chronic sleep problems.},

  abstract = {Adolescents who have displayed harmful sexual behaviour (HSB) are often described as a heterogeneous population, but different offender-, offense-, or victim-based typologies have been proposed. Two common typologies are based on the victim's age and/or on offender\textendash victim age discrepancies. Using data from a Norwegian clinical sample, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of two subgroups of adolescents: those with younger/child victims (HSB-C) and peer victims (HSB-P). The sample was collected from a public child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic. N = 54 boys, mean age 14.1 (younger age: HSB-C, n = 30, equal age: HSB-P, n = 24). Based on patient records, all patient registries within the sample were reviewed retrospectively. The data were analysed in R with different statistical tests (e.g. N - 1 chi-square test, Fisher's exact test). After adjusting the p values for multiple comparisons, none of the test statistics showed significant results. Based on the magnitude of the effect-size estimates, the following tendencies and potential meaningful differences emerged: more adolescents in the HSB-C group had experienced their own trauma early (V = 0.42), had more than one victim (V = 0.32), and had displayed repeated HSB (V = 0.27), and their caregivers required extensive interventions (V = 0.20). More adolescents in the HSB-P group had cognitive abilities in the normal/high range (V = 0.32), and their caregivers more often had difficulties acknowledging the need for support and treatment (V = 0.20). The nonsignificant differences between the subgroups, despite some strong and moderate effects, bring about a discussion on the utility of using ``victim age'' in combination with the ``offender\textendash victim age differences'' as the sole classification criterion for adolescents who have displayed HSB. The heterogeneity of the adolescent HSB population and lack of reliable information on more homogenous subgroups dynamics will remain challenges for clinicians and other practitioners needing a broad assessment and intervention focus.},

URMs and youth in foster care are high-risk groups taken care of by the CWS in Norway. Little is known on whether knowledge gained from youth in foster care can inform services for URMs, and if these groups are comparable in terms of experiences of potential traumatic events (PTEs) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom load. Eighty-one URMs reported PTEs and PTSD-symptoms using an adapted version of the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS). Responses were described and compared with a sample of 303 youth in foster care in linear regression models. We present relative risks (RR) and standardized mean differences (SMD) for the PTEs and the PTSD subscale and total score between the groups in forest plots. URMs had experienced a mean (standard deviation) of 6.4 (3.4) PTEs and 43.9\% reported to have PTSD-symptoms at or above the clinical cut off. Compared to the foster youth, URMs reported more exposures of interpersonal violence outside of the family (RRs ranging from 66.4 [95\%CI 18.1; 243.5) to 1.3 (1.0, 1.5)], and more PTSD-symptoms in the re-experiencing subscale [SMD = 0.3 (95\% CI 0.1, 0.6)]. The frequency and types of PTEs and the PTSD-symptom load and profile among URMs and youth in foster care differed. Findings underscore the importance of qualified and targeted care for URMs, and that this care should differ to that of other high-risk groups in the CWS.},

Methods:               The project is located in the URM child welfare services (URM CWS) of the Bergen municipality. We invited 101 URMs older than 15 years connected to the URM CWS to participate in a comprehensive survey. Of the invited, 81 consented to participate. The survey included questions on the user's experiences and satisfaction with the URM CWS, and questions related to schooling, social support and activities after settlement. We also included standardized and validated questionnaires on potential traumatic events, mental and somatic health, protective factors and quality of life. These questionnaires have previously been used in two Norwegian epidemiological studies, the `Youth@Hordaland' and `Young in Foster care', facilitating comparison of the results with other youth populations in Norway.

  abstract = {Background: There is a growing amount of research literature documenting increasing social inequality and an increase in the number of children growing up in families with persistently low income in all Scandinavian countries. However, there is a research gap on the issue of income composition; what the main income sources of low-income families are in relation to the families' position to the labour market and to the welfare state, and possible implications of this to the families' potential to escape poverty. The aim of this study was to describe the complexity in income sources experienced by low-income families with and without immigrant backgrounds in Norway. Method: Families with children aged 0\textendash 17 years (N = 168 families) with low income and in need of long-standing welfare services participated in the New Patterns project. We used a parallel mixed-methods design with quantitative and qualitative research methods, using questionnaires, register data, individual and focus group interviews, workshops with family coordinators and ethnographic fieldwork. Results: Most parents included in the study had low education (51\%) and a low proportion participated in the labour market (21\%). Twenty different income sources or benefits that the families received were identified and no clear pattern of type of income sources that families received emerged. Families with immigrant background were more likely to receive basic subsistence benefits than non-immigrant background families, and there were corresponding small differences in employment status upon entering the New Patterns project. Several benefits are reduced if families receive other types of income and the interdependence between the various revenue sources increases the unpredictability of total family income. The families have varying degrees of economic literacy, practical finance skills and competence in managing bureaucracy. Conclusion: Income volatility and mechanisms in the Norwegian welfare system contribute to a poverty trap for low-income families who depend on benefits that are not work-related.},

Services for families with low income are often fragmented and poorly integrated, and few coordinated initiatives have been implemented and evaluated in Norway. AIMS: The aim of the current study is to evaluate how integrated and coordinated services provided over a prolonged period by a family coordinator are related to changes across a wide range of health, wellbeing and home environment indicators for the participants. METHODS: The study uses a mixed methods approach utilising survey and register data, as well as information from interviews and shadowing, to document and evaluate outcomes associated with the intervention and the process of implementation. Data are gathered at baseline and annually throughout the duration of the study. Participants are identified to facilitate longer-term follow-up using register data. CONCLUSIONS: This project will develop important knowledge about the implementation of coordinated services to families with a low income, and how this way of organizing services influences important outcomes for the family members in the short and long term.},

  abstract = {Background The link between parental divorce and adolescents' academic achievement may depend on parental educational levels. However, findings have been inconsistent regarding whether the negative associations between parental divorce and adolescents' academic outcomes are greater or smaller in highly educated families. The present study aimed to investigate the possible heterogeneity in the associations between divorce and adolescents' academic achievement by parental educational levels, within the context of the elaborate Norwegian welfare state. Methods The population-based cross-sectional youth@hordaland study of adolescents aged 16\textendash 19 years conducted in Norway in 2012, provided information about parental divorce and was linked to national administrative registries (N = 9,166) to obtain high-quality, objective data on the adolescents' grade point average (GPA), and their parents' educational qualifications and income. Results The negative association between parental divorce and GPA was stronger among adolescents with educated or highly educated parents compared to adolescents with less educated parents. This heterogeneity was driven by maternal educational qualifications, whereby divorce was more strongly and negatively associated with GPA among adolescents with educated mothers compared to those with less educated mothers, independent of paternal educational levels and income measures. Conclusions Among adolescents whose parents have low educational qualifications, parental divorce is not associated with their academic achievement. Educated divorced mothers appear less likely to transfer their educational advantages onto their children than nondivorced equally educated mothers, perhaps due to a ``double-burden'' regarding work pressure and child-rearing responsibilities. There is a need for future studies to detail the mechanisms underlying this finding.},

Methods: The data were from the Pathways to Independence study of URMs aged 15\textendash 20 years (n = 81; 82.7\% male; response rate 80\%) conducted in 2018\textendash 2019 in the Bergen municipality, Norway. The data from the URMs were linked to an age- and sex-matched group of young people from the Norwegian youth@hordaland study conducted in 2012 (n = 324). Mental health was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: URMs were more likely to agree with most items pertaining to emotional problems, peer problems and prosocial subscales than Norwegian young people. Few differences were found for items on the conduct problems and hyperactivity-inattention problems scales. Poor psychometric properties, including weak factor loadings and low internal consistency, were detected for the SDQ subscales among URMs, except for the emotional problems subscale, indicating that the originally proposed five-factor model fitted the data poorly. Conclusions: URMs appear to have moderately more emotional problems than Norwegian young people. They are more likely to report being alone, getting along better with adults than with their peers and being bullied, but also report being more helpful and sharing with others. Studies with larger samples of URMs should determine the most appropriate factor structure of the SDQ when administered to URM samples.},

  abstract = {Background: Perfectionism in adolescence has received increased attention, but few studies have examined this in non-clinical samples. This study investigated perfectionism among adolescents from the general population in relation to demographic factors.Methods: The present study is cross-sectional and draws on the epidemiological youth@hordaland study. The sample consisted of 10.217 adolescents aged 16\textendash 19 years (52.9\% girls). Self-reported perfectionism was assessed by the EDI-P scale from the Eating Disorder Inventory with two dimensions of perfectionism, namely self-oriented (SOP) and socially prescribed (SPP) perfectionism, and a total score. Perfectionism was analyzed in relation to age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) by perceived economic well-being and parental education level. Chi-squared tests, t-tests, and regression analyses were performed.Results: There were few gender differences on the mean scores on perfectionism, with similar levels on the total score of EDI-P and SOP, while girls scored slightly higher on SPP (p {$<$} 0.001). The latter gender difference represented a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.053). Chi-square analyses with perfectionism split at the 90th percentile across gender showed that there were significantly more girls than boys among the high scorers both for EDI-P, EDI-SOP, and EDI-SPP. There were no significant differences between levels of perfectionism between the three age groups. The logistic regression analyses adjusted by age and gender showed that adolescents with a better perceived economic well-being had increased odds of high perfectionism. This was evident for overall EDI-P (OR = 1.760, 95\% CI = 1.493\textendash 2.076), SOP (OR = 1.543, 95\% CI = 1.292\textendash 1.843), and SPP (OR = 1.836, 95\% CI = 1.559\textendash 2.163). Parental education was not significantly associated with perfectionism scores among the adolescents.Conclusions: The levels of perfectionism were relatively similar between the genders in the present study, besides slightly higher SPP among girls than boys. There were also significantly more girls than boys among the high scorers on overall perfectionism, SOP, and SPP, respectively. High perfectionism was related to SES for perceived economic well-being, but not for parental education level. Implications for further research and clinical interventions were suggested.},

Prenatally exposed children had significantly higher SNAP-IV scores associated with ADHD symptoms in both areas of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity and also reported a higher ASSQ score related to an increased number of symptoms associated with ASD, compared with the reference group. Of tested predictors of mental health outcomes in the exposed group, the intelligence quotient was a strong predictor of most mental health outcomes, and neonatal abstinence syndrome was a predictor of inattention.

  abstract = {It is well established that mental health problems are highly recurrent and persistent from childhood to adolescence, but less is known to what extent mental health problems also persist from adolescence into young adulthood. The aim of the current study was therefore to examine the chronicity and risk of mental health problems and suicidality from adolescence to young adulthood. Data stem from two Norwegian population-based studies conducted 6 years apart; the youth@hordaland study from 2012 (age 16\textendash 19) and the SHoT2018 study (age 22\textendash 25). These two data sources were linked to produce a longitudinal sample of 1257 individuals. A wide range of self-reported mental health and suicidality instruments (used both continuously and categorically) were analyzed using log-link binomial regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, parental education, and financial problems. We found that high levels of mental health problems in late adolescence were a significant risk factor for reporting poor mental health 6 years later. Internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence were associated with a 2.8-fold and 1.9-fold increased risk, respectively, of reporting a mental disorder 6 years later. Similarly, self-harm in adolescence was associated with a 2.1-fold increased risk of suicidal thoughts 6 years later. The magnitudes of the adjusted risk ratios were generally similar across the various mental health and suicidality measures used at the two assessment points. Adjustment for confounders did not, or only slightly, attenuate the risk ratios, and all associations remained statistically significant in the adjusted analyses. This longitudinal study provides new evidence of the chronicity of mental health problems and suicidality from adolescence to adulthood in Norway. The results emphasize the importance of early identification and timely interventions to reduce the prevalence and impact of mental health problems and suicidality.},

Data from the Norwegian population-based youth@hordaland-survey was employed, and the analysed included n=8,983 adolescents aged 16-19 years. This information was linked to registry-based information about childhood family income for seven consecutive years prior to adolescents' participation in the youth@hordaland-survey. Latent class analyses were used to examine associations between patterns of family economic circumstances in childhood and subsequent substance use in adolescence. Based on the latent class analysis, we identified four distinct patterns of family economic circumstances: A `never poor' (89.3\%) group, followed by two groups characterized by moving in (3.0\%) or out (4.6\%) of poverty, and a final `chronically poor' (3.1\%) group. Several findings were of interest: The chronically poor reported less daily snus use, fewer had tried alcohol, were less likely to report frequent intoxication, and less prone to have potential alcohol- or drug-related problems compared to all other groups. They were also less likely to have tried any illicit drug compared to those moving in or out of poverty. Finally, the chronically poor reported more daily smoking than the never poor group, but less daily smoking than the moving out of poverty group. The never poor group was less likely to have tried any illicit drugs compared to the groups moving into or out of poverty, and less likely to smoke daily compared to the moving out of poverty group. In other words, the present study somewhat surprisingly suggested lower substance use among the chronically poor adolescents compared to other adolescents on several of the measures of substance use.},

We used a cross-sectional survey, with N = 513 (56\%; mean age 17.1 years; 58\% boys) students from a senior high school in Norway. Associations between focus on SOME self-presentation and symptoms of anxiety and depression and quality of life were investigated using blobbograms, standardized mean difference (SMD), and gender-specific linear regression models. A high focus on SOME self-presentation was associated with more mental health problems and reduced quality of life. The strength of the associations with symptoms of depression (0.75SMD) and anxiety (0.71SMD) was large, while it was medium-large for quality of life (-0.58SMD). The association was similar across gender in relation to symptoms of anxiety. For symptoms of depression and quality of life, the association was stronger for girls compared to boys.

  abstract = {ObjectivesTo investigate the association between subjective socioeconomic status (SES) and a) frequency and daily duration of social media use, and b) self-reported negative experiences on social media platforms.MethodsThe present study is based on the cross-sectional school-based ``LifeOnSoMe''-study (N = 3,415) recruiting high school students aged 16 years or more in Bergen, Norway. Subjective SES was the independent variable and measured by perceived family affluence. The dependent variables included self-reported amount of social media use, and eight different types of negative experiences on social media. Self-reported age, gender, country of birth and type study were used as covariates. Statistical analyses included multinomial logistic regression and negative binomial regression models.ResultsFor amount of social media use, we only found relatively weak and inconsistent associations with SES. In contrast, the associations between SES and separate variables gauging negative experiences were robust in crude models as well as in models adjusted for age and gender. The number of different negative experiences were increased by 1.25 times for those with low and by 1.10 times for those with medium socioeconomic status, compared to those with high socioeconomic status in fully adjusted models. For composite measures of ``negative acts and exclusion'' and ``unwanted attention from others,'' the difference between low and high SES was equivalent to a small-to-moderate effect size even after adjustments for age, gender, country of birth, type of study and amount of social media use.ConclusionsIn the present study, we found consistent and strong support for an association between SES and negative experiences on social media even after adjustments for age, gender, country of birth, type of study, and amount of social media use. The potential link between SES and negative experiences on social media as reported in this study is likely to have a public health impact. As the reported findings are novel, they need to be replicated in forthcoming studies based on other study populations. Future research should also focus on other aspects of SES and negative experiences, as well as endeavor to investigate potential longitudinal associations.},

Specifically, the relationship between alcohol consumption per se and adverse health consequences seems to vary across SES. This observation is called the `alcohol harm paradox'. This study aims to describe different patterns of alcohol use and potential problems.

Individual response patterns of the ten-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were analysed and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify latent groups. Next, the associations between the classes identified in the best fitting LCA-model and sociodemographic factors were analysed and presented.ResultsWe identified three classes based on the response patterns on AUDIT. Class 1 was characterised by low-level alcohol consumption and very low probability of negative alcohol-related consequences related to their alcohol consumption. Class 2 was characterised by a higher level of consumption, but despite this, class 2 also had a relatively low probability of reporting negative alcohol-related consequences. Class 3, however, was characterised by high levels of alcohol consumption, and a high probability of reporting negative consequences of their consumption. The classes identified were systematically differentially associated with the included measures of SES, with class 3 characterised by younger age, more males and lower educational attainment.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the interconnectedness of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, the identified classes and SES yields further insights into to intricate relationship between various socioeconomic factors, alcohol use patterns and related negative consequences.},

In the present study, we used a person-centered approach to explore whether civic engagement was related to optimal trajectories of mental health compared to other trajectories. We also examined how sociodemographic factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES), gender and age were related to youth mental health trajectories.MethodsOur sample comprised 675 students (aged 16\textendash 22) who had participated in three waves of data collection (Mage = 18.85, SD = 0.55; 43\% males) in the COMPLETE project, a cluster-randomized controlled trial that involved Norwegian upper secondary schools.ResultsThe results revealed three trajectories of mental health (reflecting a combination of mental distress and mental well-being): optimal, intermediate, and sub-optimal. Contrary to our expectations, higher levels of civic engagement were not related to the optimal trajectory of mental health vs. other trajectories. However, we found that students who reported higher levels of SES and males were more likely to follow the optimal trajectory compared to other trajectories.DiscussionWhile the findings on civic engagement could be due to our measurement's inability to capture the concept of ``dugnad,'' a well-established civic activity in the Norwegian society, the findings regarding the influence of SES and gender suggest that there is still more work to be done concerning the assessment and advancement of factors that can address mental health inequalities across SES and gender.},
