	abstract = {Background The link between parental divorce and adolescents’ academic achievement may depend on parental educational levels. However, findings have been inconsistent regarding whether the negative associations between parental divorce and adolescents’ academic outcomes are greater or smaller in highly educated families. The present study aimed to investigate the possible heterogeneity in the associations between divorce and adolescents’ academic achievement by parental educational levels, within the context of the elaborate Norwegian welfare state. Methods The population-based cross-sectional youth@hordaland study of adolescents aged 16–19 years conducted in Norway in 2012, provided information about parental divorce and was linked to national administrative registries (N = 9,166) to obtain high-quality, objective data on the adolescents’ grade point average (GPA), and their parents’ educational qualifications and income. Results The negative association between parental divorce and GPA was stronger among adolescents with educated or highly educated parents compared to adolescents with less educated parents. This heterogeneity was driven by maternal educational qualifications, whereby divorce was more strongly and negatively associated with GPA among adolescents with educated mothers compared to those with less educated mothers, independent of paternal educational levels and income measures. Conclusions Among adolescents whose parents have low educational qualifications, parental divorce is not associated with their academic achievement. Educated divorced mothers appear less likely to transfer their educational advantages onto their children than nondivorced equally educated mothers, perhaps due to a “double-burden” regarding work pressure and child-rearing responsibilities. There is a need for future studies to detail the mechanisms underlying this finding.},

	abstract = {Background: Loneliness is a major public health concern among college and university students, the evidence is inconsistent regarding whether there is an increasing trend or not. Furthermore, knowledge of the demographic determinants for loneliness are limited. The present study assesses recent trends of loneliness from 2014 to 2018, and explores demographic risk indicators of loneliness among students.
Method: Data was drawn from two waves of a national student health survey from 2014 and 2018 for higher education in Norway (the SHoT-study). In 2018, all 162,512 fulltime students in Norway were invited to participate and 50,054 students (69.1\% women) aged 18-35 years were included (response rate = 30.8\%). Loneliness was measured by “The Three-Item Loneliness Scale” (T-ILS) and one item from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25).
Results: Age showed a curvilinear association with loneliness, with the youngest and oldest students reporting the highest level of loneliness across all measures. Other significant demographic determinants of loneliness were being female, single and living alone. There was a considerable increase in loneliness from 2014 (16.5\%) to 2018 (23.6\%, p \&amp;lt; .001), and the increase was particularly strong for males, for whom the proportion of feeling “extremely” lonely had more than doubled.
Conclusion: The high rate of loneliness and the increasing trends indicate the need for preventive interventions in the student population.},

	abstract = {Introduction Depression is a public health concern among youth, and it is pertinent to identify factors that can help prevent development of depressive symptoms in adolescence. This study aimed to investigate the association between negative life events and depressive symptoms among adolescents, and to examine the influence and relative contributions of personal, social and family protective factors related to resilience. Methods Data stem from the cross-sectional youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Hordaland, Norway. In all, 9,546 adolescents, aged 16–19 years old (52.8\% girls) provided self-report information on depressive symptoms, negative life events and protective factors related to resilience. Results Experiencing a higher number of negative life events was related to increases in depressive symptoms, while the potential protective factors goal orientation, self-confidence, social competence, social support, and family cohesion individually were associated with fewer symptoms. Although there were small moderating effects of goal orientation and self-confidence, the results mainly supported a compensatory resilience model. When considering the potential protective factors jointly, only self-confidence and family cohesion were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms for both genders, with the addition of social support for girls. There were significant interactions between all the potential protective factors and gender, indicating a greater reduction of depressive symptoms with higher levels of protective factors among girls. Conclusions Interventions aimed at fostering self-confidence and family cohesion could be effective in preventing depressive symptoms for adolescent boys and girls, regardless of their exposure to negative events. Results further indicate that preventive interventions targeting these potential protective factors could be especially beneficial for adolescent girls.},

	abstract = {Study objective
The aim of the study is to assess stability and predictors of insomnia and sleep duration from adolescence to early adulthood.
Methods
A longitudinal sample of 1257 individuals from three age cohorts were assessed from linked population-based studies, the youth@hordaland study from 2012 (age 16–18) and the SHoT2018 study (age 22–25). Identical measures of insomnia symptoms and sleep duration were analysed.
Results
The stability of insomnia was high from adolescence to young adulthood, 50\% of those with insomnia symptoms in adolescence still had insomnia symptoms six years later (adjusted IRR = 2.01; (CI 95\%; 1.5–2.44)). Short sleep duration was also stable, with 67.8\% of the adolescents in the lowest sleep duration quartile still remaining in the lowest quartile six years later. The overall rate of insomnia symptoms, long wake after sleep onset (WASO), and oversleeping increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Also, we observed a reduction in sleep efficiency and later rise times. There was no significant change in sleep onset latency (SOL).
Conclusion
Insomnia symptoms and short sleep duration are prevalent during both adolescence and young adulthood. Considerable individual stability and a rising rate of insomnia symptoms were observed over time. These findings underscore the importance of early identification and timely interventions to prevent chronic sleep problems.},

	abstract = {Aim
This study aimed to investigate individual and team sports participation across sex, age, and levels of body mass index (BMI). We also wanted to explore how symptoms of disordered eating (DE) were associated with participation in individual and team sports, and to what extent BMI moderated this association.
Methods
Data stemmed from a large population-based survey of 10,172 Norwegian adolescents aged 16 to 19 years. Self-reported participation in organized team- and individual sports were the dependent variables. Self-reported symptoms of DE using the five-item Eating Disturbance Screening (EDS-5) questionnaire comprised the independent variable. Covariates included sex, age, socioeconomic status, and BMI. We used regression analyses for associations between DE symptoms and sports participation, including the interaction between DE and BMI.
Results
Boys had higher team sports participation compared with girls. Individual and team sports participation varied significantly across BMI levels for each sex. Symptoms of DE were negatively associated with team sports participation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, p {\textless} 0.001), and were not significantly associated with individual sports participation. BMI scores moderated the association between DE symptoms and individual sports participation (p {\textless} 0.005). DE symptoms were associated with higher individual sports participation among individuals with low BMI, and with lower participation among those with high BMI.
Conclusions
DE symptoms are important correlates of sports participation among adolescents, but the direction of these associations partly differs across the weight spectrum. Promotion of factors that counteract DE is needed alongside efforts to increase physical activity and sports participation in the general adolescent population.},
